# Projects

Hello, I am currently an undergraduate computer science student at Bradley University concentrating in data science. 
I've also taken/will be taking classes pertaining to cryptography, as well as project management and software engineering. 
Computers and AI are huge passions of mine, I also thuroughly enjoy the gym and cars as well, I drive an '07 Miata and plan 
on doing some upgrades to it in the future. Cats are the superior pet choice but I love my dogs too!
